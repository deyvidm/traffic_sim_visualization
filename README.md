## What even is this? 

This is a visualization suite built for my research project, a multilane highway traffic simulation model developed in MATLAB ([here](https://github.com/deyvidm/traffic_sim)). 

It moves colourful rectangles (cars) according to a set of X and Y values over T time segments. 

Most of my efforts during the semester went toward the simulation because it was the focus of my research, and the only component to receive grading. The visualizer was created in my spare time to help illustrate my progress and changes to my supervisor as we worked through the semester. 

The final product tremendously helped illustrate my semester's work to my grading committee and peers.
